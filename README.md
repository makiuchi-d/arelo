 - Monitoring file patterns are specified as glob
   - globstar (**; matches to zero or more directories) supported
   - can match the no extention filename
 - Any command line tool can be executed
   - not only go project
 - No http server

The detections within the delay are ignored.

The duration is specified as a number with a unit suffix ("ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h").

### -s, --signal signal
